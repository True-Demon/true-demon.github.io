**The Hacker Ethos** is a condensed, easy-to-read guidebook on the subject of Ethical Hacking and Penetration Testing, the legal procedure for testing computer security by simulating real cyber attacks.

Written by an expert in Computer Science and Information Security with ten years of experience in his field at the time of writing, The Hacker Ethos was specifically designed to be put in the hands of the beginner-level hacker, IT professional, and hopeful IT security researcher.

This book covers the fundamental concepts of computer science and introduces the core knowledge that is required by all security professionals in the IT industry. The primary goal of the book is to instill what is known as the "Hacker Ethic" into the reader, a philosophy based on the ideal of free information, knowledge, and speech. Its very foundation is the principle of what it means to be a true hacker, an expert in computers at the most primal level, ready to explore new concepts and techniques without ever losing the hunger for knowledge.

## About the Contents

The reader is encouraged to understand that Hacking is not easy. In fact, it's not even very clearly defined what hacking is exactly. In my mind, it encompasses a vast array of fields and skills, covering every scope of technology that includes programming, exploitation, web security and design, application security, viruses and malware, networking, wireless technology, telecommunication, telephony & cellular technology, robotics, and everything that can be classified under the school of computing. Hackers can be jacks of all trades, masters of one, and never knowing everything but always striving to learn more.

With that idea, I wrote _The Hacker Ethos_ to define and present that mindset as something to be achieved by the reader. I wanted to encapsulate the idea of what it means to be a hacker. Contained in this book are the topics of hacker ethics, and the legal grey area of computer tresspassing. It casts a bright spotlight on the subculture of hacking in an attempt to dispel the mystique of it all. It teaches the core techniques of hacking, the *Hacker Methodology"*, the list of techniques used by professional security testers and cyber-criminals alike to attack their targets.

It teaches critical research techniques, heavily emphasizing self-study, and provides dozens of free resources on the various subjects and schools of hacking, including: programming, web hacking, service and application exploitation, malware development, password cracking, wireless and local network penetration, cryptography and much more.

Lastly, the book provides a massive toolkit of professional and privately used hacking tools, all completely free, and teaches the reader how to acquire and build new tools for themselves.

This book has been hailed by readers as "the best and easiest beginner's guide to hacking," meticulously having collected and organized every necessary tool, technique, and tutorial that beginners of the IT Security field absolutely must know.

Its primary lesson is "teach you how to teach yourself," an invaluable skill that drives the field of technology and security more than any other. A hacker who cannot learn on his own will never last.

This book requires strong dedication and an insatiable desire to learn. Make no mistake, its contents will not be simple by any means, as much as it strives to make them easy to understand. There is no "hacking tools that does it all" and there is no magic trick to learning everything.

## History of the book & its publication
I published *The Hacker Ethos* shortly after I ended my struggle to break into the industry when I became a professional penetration tester. The book was intended to simply be a handful of pages with some helpful tips for beginners to steer them in the right direction while studying to become penetration testers and eventually earn the certifications that would help them along in their career.

As it grew, readers asked I continue to contribute advice to the (at the time) essay. It grew to 100 pages within the first three months of writing it, up to which point I had been publishing its progress freely on the clear net security forum, *HackForums.net*. The book quickly outgrew its original intent, and after deciding it would become a published book, it took another eight months to completely write, review, revise, and self-publish it.

In the end it cost over $2,000 in the expenses to complete the work, not accounting for my time spent writing it. Though difficult, publishing my first book in my favorite subject on computers has been an extremely rewarding and gratifying experience. It was always my goal to help teach others how to learn from and avoid my mistakes, build on the knowledge I already had, and help bring others into the fold.

It's no secret the InfoSec field has historically been an extremely difficult industry to break into, and that was part of my motivation for writing *The Hacker Ethos*. I'm glad that by writing this book, I helped make that journey a little easier for some of the eager newbies with that same drive. It's been an incredible experience, and I will always be thankful to the readers and people who supported my writing.
