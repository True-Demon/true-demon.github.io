>King Phisher is an attacker-focused penetration testing tool that assists in creating convincing, sneaky little phishing emails in a handful of different ways. The project aims to aid attackers in breaching the perimeter in ways that no other tool can claim to do. The tool is a server/client pair that operates by combining web and mail services, and consolidating/simplifying DNS. <br /><br />
>The server is built to host phishing websites based on templates and are highly customizable with jinja tags. The server also sends the phishing emails on behalf of the client, along with capturing credentials, dropping malicious links & payloads, and notifying the attacker when there is traffic/success from the phish.<br /><br />
>The client-side application communicates with the server to set up the email itself, allowing the attacker to rapidly create a convincing HTML-formatted email phish or calendar invitation. Additional features include a plugin-based feature system, including convenience add-ons such as the various notifications plugins, and phishing/stealth plugins such as the message padding and tracking-dot images to bypass spam filters & detect when emails are opened. <br /><br />
>All in all, King Phisher is the largest project I've contributed to, as well as the most enjoyable learning experience.
